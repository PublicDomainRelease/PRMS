   2.1    95/08/15  miscellaneous changes, most notably:

                    include files:  (1) file names changed from upper case to
                    lower case, (2) SAVE added to all includes, (3) all of the
                    definition include files (D____.INC) were combined into the
                    file defin.inc, these files were not actually ever included
                    in the source

                    When prms was compiled on a Silicon Graphics, problems were
                    found with some formats and with some variables that needed
                    to be saved:

                    code group    routine    format #    variable
                    ----------    -------    --------    --------
                    datint.f      datin      924
                    sumallt.f     sumall     510
                    maint.f       temp                   iftsw
                    maint.f       timey                  mxjd, mth
                    maint.f       solrad                 lp

                    In subroutine solrad, added the variable jkeep to
                    make sure 'j' was defined after the do 20 loop.
