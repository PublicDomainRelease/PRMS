  The Unix version of PRMS is documented below.  A few minor
  changes have been made to input card groups 1 and 4.  The
  biggest program change is the way the time series data is
  accessed.  Time series data is read from a WDM file.  WDM
  files are created using IOWDM.  PRMS outputs time series
  data to WDM files.  These files are documented in the
  references listed below.
